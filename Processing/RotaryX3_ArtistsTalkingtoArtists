/*RotaryX3: Artists Talking to Artists
This code is version three of the RotaryX project, which uses a rotary phone as a recorder and playback machine. 
This code runs with an arduino program that is uploaded to the board in the phone. The arduino should plug into the computer's USB port,
and the phone's receiver should plug into the headphone jack in the computer (see instructible for more details).

In this version of RotaryX, art gallery visitors (humans) are instructed to interact with the phone in the following way:
If it rings, answer it. It will play an instructional message and then a question from the recording log.
To record a question, dial 0.
To listen to a randomely selected question and record you answer, dial 7.
To listen to a randomely selected question-answer combo, dial 6.

Rotary X is a basic rotary phone recorder and playback machine. For use with Arduino and an old rotary phone.
*--------------------------
*This code reads strings from Arduino and then uses the Minim player to record and playback a series of audio files. 
The referenced sounds are not included, but they can easily be subbed with your own tracks.
